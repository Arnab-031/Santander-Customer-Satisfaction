# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction
Santander Bank aims to identify dissatisfied customers early to boost retention. Many unhappy customers leave without raising concerns. By predicting dissatisfaction, Santander can proactively address issues, enhance experiences, and build loyalty. This initiative ensures customer satisfaction and strengthens long-term relationships.
